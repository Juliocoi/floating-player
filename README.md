This extension will no longer be updated. Thank you for using "Floating Player"!

Google Chrome 70 already has native Picture-in-Picture, so you don't need an extension anymore! Just create a new bookmark and add this code as URL:

    javascript:document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].requestPictureInPicture();
